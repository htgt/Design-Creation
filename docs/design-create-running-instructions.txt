SETUP:
======
ssh into the t87-dev vm:
    ssh t87-dev

setup your environment to point to the live LIMS2 database: 
    use lims2-production


RUNNING MULTIPLE DESIGNS:
=========================
Using the template spreadsheet I sent create a file with details of the exons you want to target.

Use the create-multiple-designs.pl script.

You can check the input of the file first by running in dry-run mode:
    create-multiple-designs.pl --file [design csv file] --gibson-del-exon --dir [your work directory] --dry-run

If you are happy with the output run the commant in persist mode:
    create-multiple-designs.pl --file [design csv file] --gibson-del-exon --dir [your work directory] --persist

If run with the persist flag then design attempt records will be created in LIMS2, you can use this to track
the progress of the designs.

To see all the options for this script run the following:
    create-multiple-designs.pl --man

Notes of design file:
* The design file must be in the csv format.
* The column headers must match up with the command line parameters ( apart from the comment column )
* Leave a cell blank if you want to use the default values.

RUNNING SINGLE DESIGN:
======================
Use the following command to list all the types of designs you can make:
    design-create

To look at the options for a specific design type:
    design-create [cmd-name]
    e.g. design-create gibson-design-exon

Most of the parameters are optional ( they default to a sensible value ), but some are compulsory. 
To run the design use the command like this:
    design-create [cmd-name] [options]
    e.g. design-create gibson-design-exon --dir test_dir --target-gene HGNC:253 --five-prime-exon ENSE00001245 --debug --persist

Important Parameters:
 --persist : saves the design in LIMS2
 --dir : Path to the working directory
 --debug : Show more logging output
 --target-gene : Name of target gene 
 --five-prime-exon : Ensemble exon id for single target exon or the 5' most exon if targeting multiple exons
 --three-prime-exon : Ensemble exon id for 3' most exon, must also specify a five-prime-exon
 --created-by : LIMS2 username ( email address ) that will be associated with the design
